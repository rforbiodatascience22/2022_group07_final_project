## Final project for Course 22100 (R for Biodata science)
# Genomic evidence and flight performance for different monarchs population

This project is based on the paper [Genomic evidence for panmixia of eastern and western North American migratory monarch butterflies](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061%2Fdryad.hh4j1f6).

Monarch butterflies are known for their spectacular annual migration in eastern North America, with millions of monarchs flying up to 4,500 kilometers to overwintering sites in central Mexico. This paper focuses on evaluation of flight performance of these butterflies and also a genetic analysis of the difference between the two species Eastern Monarchs and Western Monarchs.
